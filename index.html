            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are systems that records changes made to a file over time so that you can access specific versions of that file at any given time. Version control systems are very important for web designers and graphic designers. There three kinds of VCS: Local VCS, Centralized VCS, and Distributed VCS. Local VCS is the most common method chosen by people because it is the most simple but it is also very prone to errors. Centralized VCS allow developers to collaborate with each other on different systems. The system uses a single server and allows developers to check out a file from that server and work on it. A distributed VCS doesn’t let you check out the actual file, but rather has copies of the repositories. If the server dies, you will be able to get everything backed up.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many benefits to using a version control system. One of those benefits is that files cannot be over written. This is good because it ensures that nobody can manipulate or ruin any data that you can been working on. Another benefit is that there is a common repository that holds all of the files. These keep older versions of the files and the most updated versions. VCS also allow people to work on the same file at the same time without running into any issues. This will allow for work to get done a lot quicker and more efficiently. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a type of version control system. It is a way to store and think about data. Git is very different from other version control systems. The major difference is how Git thinks about its data. It stores your data as snapshots; so every time you commit your data it has a snapshot of what your file looks like at the date and time. Git is a lot faster than some other VCS because it only needs local files and resources to operate. Git makes it hard to lose or accidently delete any data that you have committed. Git has three main stages for your data: committed, modified, and staged. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">How Git was started</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git was created out of a controversial situation. It was started by the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel is a pretty big open source software project. From 1991-2002, their method of passing around files to edit them and make changes was just sending them as patches and archived files. They clearly needed something more efficient so in 2002 they started using BitKeeper, which is a type of distributed VCS. They were using it for free until 2005 until things went south between the two companies; causing it to no longer be free for the Linux kernel. They decided to create their own system and to make it even better. They wanted it to be faster, a simpler design, have thousands of parallel branches, be fully distributed, have more speed and data size. Thus, the creation of Git.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Each file in your directory can either be in two stages: track or untracked. It is tracked when there is a snapshot of that file saved in the repository with no modifications. If it is untracked, that mean it isn’t saved with the modifications yet. It goes from untracked, to unmodified, to modified, to staged. When it is at the staged stage, that is when you want to save it to your repository. Once is it saved it is considered tracked. The tool you use to determine which files are in which state is to use the Git status command. </p>
